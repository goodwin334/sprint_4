Sprint 4 Project
In the EDA.ipynb file we are first searching for duplicates within the vehicles file then changing NA values to either 0 or blank depending on what the column is.  From there we create scatterplots showing the information in different ways.  Then we create the average price data and created multiple histograms from different information.  We also created a new column pulling the vehicle brand from the model column and looked at price information depending on that.
